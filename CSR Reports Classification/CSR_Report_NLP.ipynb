    "#### Corporate Social Responsibility Reports (CSR)\n",
    "A corporate social responsibility (CSR) report is an internal and external facing document companies use to communicate CSR efforts around environmental, ethical, philanthropic, and economic impacts on the environment and community.    \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Natural Language Processing (NLP)\n",
    "Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of linguistics and machine learning that deals with natural (i.e., human) languages. The goal is to \"understand\" the unstructured text data and produce something new. Examples of NLP tasks are language translation, text summarization, and sentiment analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL)\n",
    "Human languages are really complex, so it is impossible to train classifiers on every single phrase. Zero-shot learning (ZSL) models allow classification of text into categories unseen by the model during training. These methods work by combining the observed/seen and the non-observed/unseen categories through auxiliary information, which encodes properties of objects.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Other common uses for zero-shot learning models are images and videos. And the uses keep growing, such as activity recognition from sensors.\n"
